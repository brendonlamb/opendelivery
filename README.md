[Promoted.ai](http://Promoted.ai): Open and Source Available search and ranking service in C++

Promoted is going open! We are in the **process of publishing the source code** that runs our internal hosted products to share with our customers and our community. In the spirit of showing progress and being open, we've published and licensed our progress to date, and we will continue to do so as we invest in editing and organizing our formerly closed source code as open for our community. Please contact us if you have any questions or would like to collaborate or use this source code.

We are currently porting our managed service from Golang to C++. This repository will be where the open C++ implementation will be published. If you are a current customer and would like source-available access of either the Golang or the C++ implementations, please email Andrew.
